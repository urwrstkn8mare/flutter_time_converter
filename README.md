# flutter_time_converter

A Time Converter app for Android and iOS made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). It is intended to be very similar to my iOS only app made with Swift, [TimeConverter](https://github.com/urwrstkn8mare/TimeConverter).

_A work in progress. Development paused indefinately._
